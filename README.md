Intelligent Applications
========================

Applications show intelligence when they can spot trends, react to unusual events, predict outcomes or recommend choices. Learn how to introduce intelligence traits into your apps including: establishing feedback loops, applying big data and machine learning techniques to classify, predict or otherwise analyze explicit and implicit signals, and operationalizing the full stack into the regular usage flow of the app.

Most every day apps, from consumer to enterprise can deliver greater customer or business benefit by learning from user behavior and other signals. In this session weâ€™ll take a pragmatic look at introducing real, useful data-driven intelligence into apps by walking through services, code and data needed to make it happen.
